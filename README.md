Fides Innova is a decentralized platform based on blockchain and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) for automatic and authentication-free communication among Internet-of-Things (IoT), smart home, and wearable devices.

The Fides Innova platform contains several network nodes distributed around the world. Each network node has: 1- An IoT backend equipped with the MQTT protocol to communicate with physical IoT devices. 2- A blockchain node that facilitates communication with other Fides Innova network nodes. 3- A service contract management module that enables automatic communication between untrusted IoT devices and users without any authentication.

Moreover, Fides Innova has a mobile application that allows network users to access their IoT devices and blockchain accounts and wallets on the network. The mobile application is available on Android and iOS.

Fides Innova introduced the concept of a Service Contract, which is a small program code to automate communication between IoT devices through the nodes. Service contracts can be managed (created/edited/browsed/enabled) through the Service Contract Management web app, which is available on each Fides Innova network node.
